# hello-world
First Repository

My name is Acksaren and I'm an aspiring software developer. I am currently learning C++ 
in school and created a page here on github to showcase what I am currently working on,
upload past workshops/projects and open myself to meet other current/upcoming software
developers.

My goal is to upload new projects I am working on and to contribute to open source projects
as much as possible. I will be adding ideas on this page of what I wish to build as well.

I am familiar with C programming, HTML, CSS, Node.js, C++, JavaScript and used IDE's such as visual studio 
and visual studio code.

As an aspiring software developer I am interested in learning Python and plan to build many projects.
